# University-Projects
Projects I have done during my time in university
The Deque Project and the Titanic Dataset Skeleton were assignments for my Data Structures class. Although I was provided with a skeleton code, I specified which parts I implemented on my own within the code. If there is any confusion, please refer to my resume for clarification. A copy of the Heart Disease Indicators project is available on a separate link in my resume. Hopefully, I will have more projects uploaded soon.
